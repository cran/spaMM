\title{Scaled distances between unique locations}
\description{
  This fonction computes scaled distances from whichever relevant argument it can use (see Details). The result can directly by used as input for computation of the Mat√©rn correlation matrix. It is usually called internally by HLCor, so that users may ignore it, except if they wish to control the distance used through \code{control.dist$method}, or the parametrization of the scaling through \code{control.dist$rho.mapping}.
}
\usage{
make_scaled_dist(uniqueGeo, uniqueGeo2=NULL, distMatrix, rho, 
                 rho.mapping=seq_len(length(rho)), 
                 dist.method="Euclidean",
                 return_matrix=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{uniqueGeo}{
     A matrix of geographical coordinates (e.g. 2 columns for latitude and longitude), without replicates of the same location.  
}
  \item{uniqueGeo2}{
     NULL, or a second matrix of geographical coordinates, without replicates of the same location.  
     If NULL, scaled distances among \code{uniqueGeo} locations are computed. Otherwise, scaled distances between  locations in the two input matrices are computed. 
}
  \item{distMatrix}{
    A distance matrix.
}
  \item{rho}{
   A scalar or vector of positive values. Scaled distance is computed as \code{<distances in each coordinate> * rho}, unless a non-trivial
   \code{rho.mapping} is used.
}
  \item{rho.mapping}{
     A set of indices controlling which elements of the \code{rho} scale vector scales which dimension(s) of the space in which (spatial) 
   correlation matrices of random effects are computed. Scaled distance is generally computed as \code{<distances in each coordinate> * rho[rho.mapping]}. As shown inthe Example, if one wishes to combine isotropic geographical distance and some environmental distance, the coordinates being latitude, longitude and one environmental variable, the scaled distance may be computed
  as (say) \code{(lat,long,env) *rho[c(1,1,2)]} so that the same scaling \code{rho[1]} applies for both geographical coordinates. In this case, \code{rho} should have length 2 and \code{rho.mapping} should be \code{c(1,1,2)}.
  }
  \item{dist.method}{\code{method} argument of \code{proxy::dist} function (by default, \code{"Euclidean"}, but other distances are possible (see Details).} 
  \item{return_matrix}{Whether to return a \code{matrix} rather than a \code{proxy::dist} or \code{proxy::crossdist} object.}
}
\details{
 The function uses the \code{distMatrix} argument if provided, in which case rho must be a scalar. Vectorial \code{rho} (i.e., different scaling of different dimensions) is feasible only by providing \code{uniqueGeo}.
 
 The \code{dist.method} argument gives access to distances implemented in the \code{proxy} package, or to user-defined ones that are made accessible to \code{proxy} through its database. Of special interest for spatial analyses are spherical distances. \code{proxy} implements the \code{"Geodesic"} distance which does not use longitude and latitude as coordinates. For this reason, spaMM implements an \code{"Earth"} method for \code{proxy::dist}, which uses longitude and latitude (in that order: see Examples) as coordinates for computing orthodromic distances in km. The Earth radius used for spherical approximation is 6371.009 km.
}
\value{
A matrix or \code{\link[proxy]{dist}} object. If there are two input matrices, rows of the return value correspond to rows of the first matrix.
