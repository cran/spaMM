# To overcome a (compiler?) bug, in case one would recompile 
# with -O3 (or -UNDEBUG?) for windows 32bit:
# see https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppEigen/issues/34
PKG_CXXFLAGS= -fno-omit-frame-pointer 
# I added -03 in R-devel/etc/x64/Makevars.site. -o0 last successfully tested (on default test_all) between spaMM v3.0.3 and 3.0.4
